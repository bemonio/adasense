# AdaSense

🚀 **AdaSense** is an MVP for Eye Tracking developed in **Ionic with Angular and TypeScript**. Its goal is to analyze the user's gaze using the device's camera and generate a heatmap based on visual attention.

## 📌 Features
- 📷 Capture images with the front camera.
- 🔍 Eye-tracking detection and analysis.
- 🌡️ Generate heatmaps to visualize points of interest.
- 📊 Store data for later analysis.
- 🎯 Possible integration with AI models to improve accuracy.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Ionic Framework** (with Angular and TypeScript)
- **TensorFlow.js** (for gaze analysis, optional)
- **Capacitor Camera API** (for image capture)
- **SQLite** (for local storage, if needed)

## 📦 Installation and Setup
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/bemonio/adasense.git
   cd adasense
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. **Run in the browser**:

   ```
4. **Run on an Android device**:
   ```sh
   ionic capacitor build android
   ```

## 🚀 Usage
1. Launch the application.
2. Press the capture button to analyze gaze.
3. View the generated heatmap.

## 📌 Roadmap
